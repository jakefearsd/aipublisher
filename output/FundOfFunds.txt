!!! FundOfFunds

A __Fund of Funds__ is an investment vehicle that pools money from investors and allocates it across a diversified portfolio of other funds rather than investing directly in individual securities. This approach aims to provide access to a wide range of asset classes, strategies, and fund managers for investors who may not have the resources or expertise to build such a diverse portfolio themselves.
