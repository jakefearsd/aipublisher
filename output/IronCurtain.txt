!!! IronCurtain

__Iron Curtain__ was an expression used during the Cold War era to describe the division between the Soviet-controlled Eastern Bloc and the Western nations. The term symbolized the ideological, political, and economic separation that characterized this period.

The concept of the Iron Curtain was popularized by British statesman Winston Churchill in his 1946 speech in [Moscow|Moscow_Speech]. It marked a significant shift from wartime alliance to post-war enmity between Western powers and the Soviet Union. The Berlin Wall, erected in 1961, became a powerful symbol of this division.
