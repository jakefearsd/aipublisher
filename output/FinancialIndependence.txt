!!! FinancialIndependence

__Financial Independence__ refers to a state where an individual's income from investments, savings, and other passive sources is sufficient to cover their living expenses without requiring active employment or additional earned income.

Achieving financial independence often involves strategies such as saving a significant portion of one's income early in life, investing wisely, and reducing expenses. This concept is closely related to the idea of becoming financially secure and free from the need for regular employment to support oneself.
