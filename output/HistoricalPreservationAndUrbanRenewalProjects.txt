!!! Historical Preservation and Urban Renewal Projects

Historical preservation and urban renewal projects are initiatives aimed at revitalizing deteriorating urban areas while preserving their historical significance. These projects often involve the demolition of old buildings to make way for new development, but they also include efforts to maintain or restore structures that have cultural or architectural value.
