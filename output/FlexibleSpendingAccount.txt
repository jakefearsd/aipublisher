!!! Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

A __Flexible Spending Account__ (FSA) is a type of tax-advantaged medical savings account in the United States that allows an individual to set aside a portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis, typically through salary reduction agreements with employers. These funds are used to pay for qualified medical expenses, thereby reducing taxable income and lowering overall healthcare costs.

* Flexible Spending Accounts are commonly offered as part of employee benefit packages and can be combined with other health savings plans like Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).
