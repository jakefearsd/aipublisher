!!! Asset Allocation Strategies

__Asset allocation strategies__ refer to the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, in order to optimize the balance between __risk__ and __return__. This approach aims to maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a desired return. Investors use these strategies based on their financial goals, time horizon, and tolerance for market volatility.
