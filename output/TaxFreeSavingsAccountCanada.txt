!!! TaxFreeSavingsAccountCanada

__Tax-Free Savings Account Canada (TFSA)__ is a registered account in Canada that allows individuals to earn tax-free investment income and withdraw funds without paying taxes on capital gains, dividends, or interest earned within the account.

Established in 2009 by the Canadian government as an alternative to Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), TFSAs provide flexibility for Canadians to save money tax-efficiently without designating the savings for retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and are not deductible, but any income earned within the TFSA grows tax-free.
