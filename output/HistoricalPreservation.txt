!!! HistoricalPreservation

__Historical Preservation__ is the practice of protecting and preserving sites, buildings, objects, and districts that are significant to a community's cultural heritage and history. This can include efforts to restore old structures, maintain public spaces with historical significance, and regulate development in areas with important historical value.

Historical preservation plays a crucial role in urban renewal projects by balancing the need for modernization with the desire to retain elements of a city’s or town’s past that contribute to its identity and character.
