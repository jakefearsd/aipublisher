!!! ColdWarArchitecture

__Cold War Architecture__ refers to the distinctive architectural styles and urban planning designs that emerged in Berlin during the period of political tension between the Soviet Union and Western powers (approximately 1947-1991). This style is characterized by utilitarian, often austere buildings constructed with a focus on functionality and security rather than aesthetics. Cold War Architecture played a significant role in shaping the physical appearance and urban landscape of East Berlin during its division from West Berlin.
