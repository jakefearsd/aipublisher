!!! Introduction to Berlin's Political Landscape Post-Reunification

Berlin became the capital of reunified Germany in 1990 following the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 7, 1989, which paved the way for German reunification. This event marked a significant turning point for both East and West Berlin, as they were reunited after decades of separation. The political landscape of Berlin has been shaped by its history as the de facto capital of West Germany and the de jure capital of East Germany. This article provides an overview of how this landscape changed post-reunification.

!! Historical Context: Division and Reunification

The division of Germany into East and West following World War II led to significant political, economic, and social changes for the city of Berlin. The construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 physically divided the city and symbolically represented the ideological divide between the Eastern Bloc and Western Allies.

[[GermanReunification]] was a complex process initiated by key figures such as [[HelmutKohl]], who played a significant role in advocating for reunification. The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, opened the way for negotiations that ultimately led to the signing of the Two Plus Four Agreement in September 1990, which officially reunited Germany.
