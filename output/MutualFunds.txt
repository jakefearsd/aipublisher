!!! MutualFunds

__Mutual Funds__ are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Each investor in a mutual fund owns shares representing their portion of the holdings.

Investors can easily access professional management and diversification by purchasing units of a mutual fund rather than buying individual securities directly.
