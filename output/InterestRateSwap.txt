!!! Interest Rate Swap

__Interest Rate Swap__ is a financial derivative contract in which two parties agree to exchange interest rate payments, typically over a fixed period of time. One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate while the other agrees to pay a floating interest rate (such as LIBOR or EURIBOR) based on an agreed principal amount.

This instrument helps entities manage their exposure to fluctuating interest rates and can be used for hedging purposes or to reduce financing costs.
