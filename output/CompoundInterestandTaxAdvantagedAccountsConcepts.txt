!!! __Compound Interest and Tax-Advantaged Accounts Concepts__

__Compound interest__ refers to the process where the interest earned on an investment is reinvested, leading to exponential growth over time. This concept is crucial in understanding how investments grow at a faster rate than simple interest. __Tax-advantaged accounts__, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, offer special tax benefits for retirement savings, allowing individuals to defer taxation on investment gains until withdrawal, often in retirement when tax rates may be lower.
