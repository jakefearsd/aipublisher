!!! Floating Interest Rate

A __floating interest rate__ is an adjustable rate that moves up and down based on market conditions. This type of interest rate typically adjusts according to a benchmark index such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a fixed margin set by the lender. The primary advantage for borrowers is the flexibility it provides, potentially allowing them to benefit from lower rates when the market shifts favorably.
