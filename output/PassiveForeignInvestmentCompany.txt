!!! PassiveForeignInvestmentCompany

A __Passive Foreign Investment Company__ (PFIC) is a foreign corporation that meets certain criteria under U.S. tax laws regarding the distribution of income and assets to its shareholders. If an individual holds shares in a PFIC, they may be subject to complex tax rules designed to prevent deferral of taxes through passive investments held outside the United States.

* __Income Test__: More than 75% of the corporation's gross income is derived from passive sources.
* __Asset Test__: At least 50% of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of passive income.

PFIC rules can significantly impact the tax planning and compliance requirements for U.S. taxpayers investing in foreign companies that generate substantial passive income.
