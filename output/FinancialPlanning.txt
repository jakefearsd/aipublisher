!!! Financial Planning

__Financial planning__ is the process of creating a comprehensive strategy for managing an individual's or organization's finances over time to achieve specific goals and objectives. This includes assessing current financial status, forecasting future needs, setting realistic goals, and developing strategies to meet those goals through budgeting, saving, investing, and other financial activities.

Financial planning helps individuals make informed decisions about their money and aligns short-term sacrifices with long-term rewards, such as retirement savings or major purchases like a home or education expenses. It is crucial for managing risks, maximizing wealth, and achieving personal financial security.
