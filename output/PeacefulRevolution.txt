!!! Peaceful Revolution

__Peaceful Revolution__ refers to a political and social movement that achieves significant change through nonviolent means. It contrasts with violent revolutions where force is used to overthrow an existing government or regime.

One of the most notable examples of a peaceful revolution occurred in 1989 in East Germany, culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall. The demonstrations were largely peaceful and led to the reunification of East and West Germany without any major armed conflict.
