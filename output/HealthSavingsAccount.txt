!!! HealthSavingsAccount

A __Health Savings Account__ (HSA) is a tax-advantaged financial account in the United States designed to help individuals save for qualified medical expenses on a pre-tax basis. HSAs are typically paired with high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), allowing individuals to set aside funds without being taxed, which can then be used to pay for eligible healthcare costs.

* __Benefits__ include tax deductions, lower taxable income, and the ability to invest funds for future medical expenses.
* __Eligibility__ generally requires enrollment in a qualifying HDHP with a higher deductible than traditional health plans.
