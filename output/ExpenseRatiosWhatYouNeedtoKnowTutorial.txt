!!! __Expense Ratios: What You Need to Know__

An expense ratio is a measure of what it costs an investment company to operate a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). It includes management fees and other operating expenses.

* Expense ratios are expressed as a percentage of the total assets under management.
* A lower expense ratio can mean higher returns for investors over time, since less money goes towards covering operational costs.
