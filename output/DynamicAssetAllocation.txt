!!! Dynamic Asset Allocation

__Dynamic Asset Allocation__ is an investment strategy that involves adjusting the mix of assets in a portfolio based on market conditions and economic forecasts to optimize returns for a given level of risk. Unlike static asset allocation, which maintains a fixed percentage of asset classes regardless of market movements, dynamic asset allocation allows for more flexibility and can help investors take advantage of changing market environments.
