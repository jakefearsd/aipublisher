!!! TaxFreeSavingsAccount

A __TaxFreeSavingsAccount__ (TFSA) is a registered savings plan offered by the government of Canada that allows individuals to save and invest tax-free income without owing tax on any money earned within the account, including investment income and capital gains. Contributions made to a TFSA are not deductible for tax purposes, but growth occurs tax-free and withdrawals are also tax-free.
