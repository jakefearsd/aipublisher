The Russian National Wealth Fund is one example of an SWF that has been instrumental in managing Russia’s fiscal stability.

The Russian National Wealth Fund (RNWF) serves as a critical component of Russia's fiscal policy, designed to stabilize the national economy and support long-term development initiatives. Established primarily with surplus revenues from oil and gas exports, it has been used to fund various state projects and cushion economic shocks caused by fluctuating commodity prices.
